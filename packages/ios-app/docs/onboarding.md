# Onboarding (iOS sheet)

The iOS app always opens to the normal dashboard after initialization.
Fresh installs present a medium-detent onboarding sheet above the
dashboard when `@AppStorage("onboardingComplete")` is false. The sheet
has three swipeable pages: a welcome page, a Mac install link page, and
the connect page. The connect page is the only page that persists
anything.

## Flow Diagram

```
TronMobileApp.init()
  ├─ TronFontLoader.registerFonts()
  └─ EventRegistry.shared.registerAll()

WindowGroup.task
  └─ AppInitializer.initialize { DependencyContainer.initialize() }

readyContent()
  ├─ always mounts ContentView
  └─ sheet(isPresented: !onboardingComplete)
       └─ OnboardingFlowView
            ├─ WelcomeOnboardingPage
            ├─ InstallMacOnboardingPage
            └─ PairingStep
                 ├─ scan QR / paste URL / enter fields
                 ├─ validate host / port / token / label
                 ├─ probe ws://host:port/ws with Authorization: Bearer token
                 ├─ send system.ping
                 ├─ persist preset + Keychain bearer
                 ├─ rebuild RPC client for the paired server
                 └─ state.complete() → dismiss sheet
```

Pairing URLs (`tron://pair?host=…&port=…&token=…[&label=…]`) are
handled in three places:

- `TronMobileApp.onOpenURL` accepts QR/deep-link launches, fills the
  pairing form, jumps to the connect page, and presents the sheet at the
  large detent.
- `QRCodeScannerSheet` scans the Mac QR code, parses the same URL shape,
  and fills the connect page.
- `Binding<String>.pasteAware` lets the user paste the full pairing URL
  into any pairing field and auto-distributes the values.

## Pairing

`PairingStep` is the only onboarding step that mutates persistent
storage and can fail mid-flight. It is split into pure helpers so the
branches are testable without SwiftUI or live networking:

```
user taps Connect
  │
  ▼
PairingStepValidator.validate(...)
  │  .failure → state.pairingError
  │
  ▼
dependencies.pairingProbe.probe(...)
  │  .unauthorized | .incompatible | .unreachable → classify + show
  │
  ▼
PairingPersistor.plan(payload, existing)
  │
  ▼
side effects:
  1. presetTokenStore.setToken(...)
  2. cache updated connectionPresets in UserDefaults
  3. dependencies.updateServerSettings(host:port:)
  4. best-effort settings.update RPC to persist presets on the server
  5. state.complete()
```

`URLSessionPairingProbe` opens a one-shot WebSocket upgrade with the
pairing bearer token and sends `system.ping`. The server emits a
`connection.established` event immediately after upgrade, so the probe
matches the `system.ping` response by request id and ignores unrelated
event frames before classifying:

- `.ok` when the server replies successfully.
- `.unauthorized` when the WebSocket upgrade gets HTTP 401.
- `.incompatible` when `system.ping` returns
  `CLIENT_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`.
- `.unreachable` for DNS, timeout, refused connection, and malformed
  responses.

If the Mac looks healthy but the iPhone reports unreachable, check that
Tailscale is connected on the iPhone and signed into the same tailnet.
The Mac server logs should show an inbound WebSocket connection when the
phone reaches it.

## QR Scanning

`QRCodeScannerSheet` uses `AVCaptureMetadataOutput` for live QR detection
and returns only the raw code string. `PairingStep` is responsible for
parsing with `PairingURLParser`, so scanning, paste, manual links, and
deep links all converge on one parser and one `OnboardingState` mutation.
The sheet reuses the chat camera sheet's compact medium-detent camera
presentation. Camera permission copy in `Info.plist` covers both pairing
QR scans and chat photo capture.

## Forgetting a Mac

Settings → Server → preset menu → "Forget this Mac" is the clean reset path
for a paired server. It removes that preset from the Mac's
`settings.json` (`server.connectionPresets`), deletes the matching iOS
Keychain bearer token, and unregisters this device's push token when the
forgotten Mac is the active server. If another preset remains, iOS switches
to it. If no presets remain, the app resets `onboardingComplete` to `false`
and shows the onboarding sheet again.

---

## Persistence Keys

All keys live exactly once on `OnboardingState` or `SettingsState`.
Never duplicate these literals inline.

| Key | Purpose | Type |
|-----|---------|------|
| `onboardingComplete` | Presents/dismisses the first-run onboarding sheet | Bool |
| `cachedConnectionPresets` | Local copy of server-side preset list | Data (JSON) |

`telemetryEnabled` belongs to `SettingsState.telemetryEnabledStorageKey`
because privacy/telemetry is configured from Settings, not onboarding.

`@AppStorage` uses `UserDefaults.standard`, not
`NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore`. Onboarding completion is per-device:
pairing an iPad must not silently mark an iPhone as paired.

---

## Per-Preset Bearer Tokens

Every `ConnectionPreset.id` has a Keychain slot at
`com.tron.mobile.bearer.<presetId>`. The onboarding sheet and settings
re-pair sheet write the token; `WebSocketService` reads it when building
the `Authorization: Bearer …` upgrade header.

Keychain accessibility is `accessibleAfterFirstUnlock` so background
reconnects after reboot can read the token once the device has been
unlocked at least once.
