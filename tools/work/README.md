# Work tooling

Repository-agnostic tooling for many agents working in one GitHub repository at
the same time. GitHub Issues and one GitHub Project are the only record of work.
This tooling holds no local registry or cache of that state.

The core lives here until a second repository adopts it (decision D-1 of the
parallel agent workflow plan). To keep that extraction mechanical:

- Nothing in this directory imports or names repository-specific code, paths,
  owners or handles.
- Everything specific to one repository lives in its `.github/work.json`.
- The repository and its owner are read from the checkout's GitHub remote at run
  time.
- It uses the Python 3.9 standard library and the GitHub CLI, and nothing else.

Tron runs it through `scripts/tron work`.

## GitHub CLI resolution

`gh` is resolved in this order:

1. `WORK_GH`;
2. `gh` on `PATH`;
3. the Homebrew locations under `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/local/bin`.

Agent shells can inherit a PATH without Homebrew, which is why step 3 exists.
Authentication stays in gh's own credential store.

## `bootstrap`

Declares the tracking vocabulary, and converges GitHub to it when you pass
`--apply`:

- repository labels;
- one owner-level Project, with its settings and a link to this repository;
- the Project's fields and single-select options.

Without `--apply` it only prints the plan. It exits 0 when nothing differs and 2
when changes are pending. With `--apply` it applies the plan, plans again, and
fails unless the second plan is empty, so every apply also proves idempotency.
`--report <path>` writes the final plan and every action taken as JSON.

It adds and updates, and never deletes a label, field or Project. Labels and
fields that are not declared are reported and left alone.

Rulesets listed in `.github/work.json` are reported, never applied. Branch rules
are an account-level change for the maintainer, and applying them before the
landing tooling exists would block today's direct pushes to `main`. The report
prints the one-line command to apply them.

### Failure modes

Isolated tests in `test_bootstrap.py` target these failure modes. The live
GitHub run covers the rest.

1. **Updating a single-select field drops option IDs.** Every Project item that
   used a dropped option silently loses its value. Options whose names match
   case-insensitively must keep their IDs, including across a rename in case
   only.
2. **An option still in use is removed.** A live option that is not declared
   may be removed only when no item uses it. Otherwise bootstrap refuses and
   names the option.
3. **Planning never converges.** The same live state must plan as unchanged on
   every run: no spurious differences from ordering, case, missing
   descriptions, or colors GitHub normalizes.
4. **A field with the right name has the wrong type.** Bootstrap refuses rather
   than deleting and recreating it, because deleting a field destroys every
   value in it.
5. **Two Projects share the declared title.** Bootstrap refuses rather than
   choosing one.
